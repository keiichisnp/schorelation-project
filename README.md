# Schorelation (WebDev Full Stack Project)
## Project Information
This project is our teamâ€™s attempt in having harmonious relationship between a manager and scholar in Axie Infinity which is very popular nowadays. This allows the scholars to have a right on having a fair amount of share. This came from noticing that because of the rise in popularity of NFT games that lead to Manager-Scholar relationships, a lot of exploitations happen, and scholars would get very low percentage of share which they do not deserve. This web application would also guide as a performance tracking app for the scholars once they have agreed to be one.
